# Samuel L Jackson SoundBoard
This repository will contain a Windows Form Application that I developed into a Soundboard with C#. The theme is based on various sound bytes from Samuel L Jackson.

I wanted to develop a Soundboard in Visual Studio and was aimlessly looking for audio packs. I found a Samuel L Jackson pack and figured, why not! 

The audio clips started as mp3s and I needed to convert them to wav files. Once I added the resources and set up the UI, I just needed to do a quick google search in regards to playing audio clips. Added the right namespace and added event handlers to listen for clicks. The rest was history. The audio clips are pretty funny too, I definitely laughed throughout the development.
